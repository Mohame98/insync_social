# Proposal for **inSync** Platform

## Team Members and Roles:

- **[Sara]** – **Design**: Will be responsible for designing the website, including the layout, user interface (UI), and visual elements like colors and fonts to ensure the site is both visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **[Nupur]** – **Front-End Development**: Will develop the templates of the website that users will see and interact with, such as the homepage, user profiles, and posts.
- **[Mohame]** – **Back-End Development**: Will work on the server-side of the website, handling data management like user accounts, posts, and comments.
- **[Collaboration]** – **Repository & Version Control**: We will collaboratively manage the GitHub repository to keep the code organized, and ensure smooth collaboration by tracking all changes to the project. We will review and merge each other's branches into the main branch when necessary.

## Who Will Use This Website?

The website will be used by all TechCorp employees, and it can be easily adapted for any company or organization that wants to improve internal communication and collaboration. Specifically, the platform will help employees:

- Stay updated on important company news and trends.
- Share their thoughts by commenting and liking posts.
- Create and organize private collections of their favorite posts.
- Customize their personal profiles with information about themselves (e.g., name, photo, job).

The primary goal of the website is to improve communication between employees, helping them stay connected and share ideas.

## Technologies Used:

We will use the following tools and technologies to build **inSync**:

- **HTML**: For the templates, to structure the content of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling the website, including colors, fonts, and layout to make the site visually appealing and easy to use.
- **JavaScript**: To enhance the functionality of the website by allowing interactive elements and dynamic components.
- **Django**: For building the back-end of the website, including user accounts, posts, and data management. Django offers built-in user authentication and security features which will allow users to securely sign in and manage their accounts.
- **SQLite**: The database used to store user data, posts, comments, and statistics.
- **Figma**: We’ll use **Figma** to design the website’s look. It helps us create wireframes and mockups to show how everything will appear on the website.

## Final Thoughts:

With **inSync**, we aim to create a unified platform where all employees at **TechCorp** can stay updated on company news, communicate with one another, and share ideas in a simple, organized way. By using **Django** for the back-end and **HTML/CSS** for the front-end, we will build a functional and visually appealing website that helps foster communication and collaboration across departments.

We believe **inSync** will improve workflow, engagement, and motivation by giving employees an efficient tool for staying connected and informed.
