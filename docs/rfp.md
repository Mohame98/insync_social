# 1. Request for Proposal (RFP)

## Client's Organization:

**TechCorp**

### About TechCorp:

TechCorp is an innovative tech company that focuses on bringing together people from different departments—like design, marketing, and development—to create exciting and interactive technologies. With a diverse team, we constantly look for ways to connect and share ideas more effectively.

### Problem We’re Facing:

Currently, we rely on emails to communicate important company updates and share news. However, emails are disorganized and not the best tool for fostering conversations or keeping track of information. It’s difficult to stay updated, and important things often get lost or forgotten. We need a more efficient and organized platform for employees to share news, ideas, and communicate easily with each other.

### What We Want (Goals):

We need a website called **inSync** where employees can:

- **Stay Updated**: View company news, posts, and important updates all in one place.
- **Engage with Content**: Comment on posts, like posts, and interact with their colleagues.
- **Ensure Safety & keep it appropriate**: Admins should have the ability to remove inappropriate or incorrect posts and comments.
- **Create Personal Profiles**: Every employee should have a profile with their photo, name, job role, and other personal details.
- **Monitor Activity**: View statistics such as user engagement, number of posts, and comments to measure activity on the site.
- **Easier Connection**: Employees should be able to connect with one another more easily, share ideas, and stay up-to-date with company news.
- **Tech Trends**: The platform should help employees stay informed about recent tech trends, innovations, and industry news to support continuous learning and innovation.
